## Usage

You can use the tool in **two ways**:

1. **Run the script directly**
   The easiest way is to run:

   ```bash
   ./save_prices.sh
   ```

   **Warning:** By default, this script also saves data to the database.  
    Make sure to check the `scheduled_price_scraping.md` section or disable it by changing the desired handlers (line 53):  

    ```bash
    $PYTHON_BIN "$SCRIPT_PATH" --handlers mysql csv
    ```
2. **Console call via Python**
   Run the script with:

   ```bash
   python easyPriceMonitor.py --handlers [csv,mysql]
   ```

   Example:
   - `python easyPriceMonitor.py --handlers csv mysql` 
   - `python easyPriceMonitor.py --handlers mysql`
